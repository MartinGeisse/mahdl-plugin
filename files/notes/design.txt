data types:
- which data types can be used for hardware constructs (wires, registers, ports)?
	- which cannot? those that have no canonical representation as bits!
	- integer: no, because this data type is unbounded
	- text: no, because this data type is unbounded
	- bit, vector: yes
	- matrix: yes. This decision was not totally clear at first, because
			hardware does not allow to read/write the whole matrix at once
		- matrix is treated as a data type, not as an implementation item.
			This type has a well-defined representation as bits -- a two-dimensional
			array (vs. vector, which is one-dimensional).
		- this means we can have matrix constants, matrix wires, matrix registers and
			matrix ports in principle.
		- matrix ports have no useful meaning in hardware (would mean: R/W whole matrix at once)
		- matrix registers represent synchronous RAM or ROM
		- asynchronous ROM could be represented as either constants or signals.
		- decision: we don't want to prevent ALL nonsense at language level. That's impossible.
			So we allow both matrix wires and matrix constants.
